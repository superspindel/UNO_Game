#########This is running the application on windows:


Example 1:
Use Intellij or Eclipse to build and run the project. This way you get colors when playing, since i have not implemented any another way then through unicode.


Example 2:

1. Run compile.bat
2. Go into bin folder
3. Execute as mentioned above for Client and Server
4. Run Tests through unittest.bat

Example 3:

1. Go inside the directory called vikfll-0
2. Execute "dir /s /B *.java > sources.txt" without the "".
3. Execute "javac @sources.txt" without the ""
4. Step into the src folder
5. To run client: execute "java Client.Client BOT/USER" ( you decide if it should be a bot or user )
6. To run Server: execute "java Server.Server INT" ( Where INT is a integer for the number of clients to use )
7. I do not know how to run tests in this way.


Example 4:
1. Go to folder "vikfll-0"
2. Execute "mkdir bin"
3. Execute javac.exe -d bin -cp src src/Client/Client.java src/Server/Server.java
4. Step into src folder
5. Run as stated in Example 3, steps 5 & 6.
